faq:
  - q: "Will sellers reject FHA offers in San Diego?"
    a: "Not always, but competitiveness varies by neighborhood and property condition. The best approach is a strong pre-approval, clean terms, and targeting properties that fit the loan profile."
  - q: "Which loan is cheaper long-term?"
    a: "It depends on interest rate, mortgage insurance, and how long you keep the loan. We compare scenarios rather than guess."
  - q: "Can I start with FHA and refinance later?"
    a: "Sometimes, yes. But refinancing depends on future rates, equity, and your profile. Treat refinance as potential upside, not a guarantee."
