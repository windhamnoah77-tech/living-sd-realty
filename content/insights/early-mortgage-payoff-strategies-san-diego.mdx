excerpt: "Paying off your mortgage early can be brilliant or dumb, depending on your rate, cash reserves, and opportunity cost. Here’s the clean decision framework."
sections:
  - h: "Start with the real question"
    p: "The question is not 'can I pay it off early?' The question is 'what’s the best use of my extra cash given my risk and goals?'"
    bullets:
      - "Liquidity matters: cash reserves protect you"
      - "Opportunity cost is real: what else could the money do?"
      - "Taxes and risk tolerance change the answer"
  - h: "Strategy 1: Extra principal payments"
    p: "The simplest strategy is also the most effective: pay extra principal. Even modest extra payments can cut years off the loan and reduce total interest."
    bullets:
      - "Confirm with your servicer how to apply extra payments to principal"
      - "Consistency beats random big payments"
      - "Keep an emergency fund first"
  - h: "Strategy 2: One extra payment per year (the clean version)"
    p: "Whether you do a true 13th payment or spread it monthly, the idea is: add a little extra principal consistently."
    bullets:
      - "Monthly: add 1/12 of a payment each month"
      - "Or: make one full extra payment annually"
      - "Avoid gimmicks; focus on principal reduction"
  - h: "Strategy 3: Mortgage recast"
    p: "A recast can lower your monthly payment after a large principal reduction without changing the loan term. It’s useful when you want lower required payments but still want to own the house long-term."
    bullets:
      - "Works best after a lump-sum principal payment"
      - "Lowers payment, keeps rate, keeps term length"
      - "Ask servicer about eligibility and fees"
  - h: "Strategy 4: Refinance (when it’s actually smart)"
    p: "Refinancing is not automatically good. It depends on rate improvement, fees, time horizon, and whether you’re shortening the term."
    bullets:
      - "Refi to lower rate can reduce interest cost"
      - "Shorter term can accelerate payoff but raises payment"
      - "Calculate breakeven: how long to recover costs?"
  - h: "Common traps and myths"
    p: "Some payoff advice is marketing dressed as math. Don’t get played."
    bullets:
      - "Biweekly payment programs you can do yourself (for free)"
      - "Draining reserves to pay down principal and then using credit cards in emergencies"
      - "Obsessing over payoff while ignoring high-interest debt"
  - h: "The smart middle: build strength first"
    p: "The best long-term plan is usually: kill high-interest debt, build reserves, then attack principal or invest based on your goals."
    bullets:
      - "Emergency fund first"
      - "High-interest debt second"
      - "Then: extra principal vs investing based on your rate and risk tolerance"
        - h: "Related guides"
    p: "If you’re buying now and planning long-term wealth, start with these."

faq:
  - q: "Is paying off a mortgage early always the best move?"
    a: "No. It can be a great move for risk reduction and peace of mind, but it may not be the best financial move if you sacrifice reserves or ignore higher-interest debt."
  - q: "Is biweekly better than monthly?"
    a: "Biweekly can create an extra payment per year, but you can replicate the effect by simply paying extra principal monthly. Avoid paying fees for programs."
  - q: "What’s the difference between recast and refinance?"
    a: "Recast lowers your monthly payment after paying down principal while keeping the same loan and rate. Refinance replaces your loan with a new one, changing rate/term and usually involving closing costs."
