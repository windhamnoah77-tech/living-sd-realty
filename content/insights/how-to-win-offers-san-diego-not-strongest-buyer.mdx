excerpt: "You don’t need to be the strongest buyer to win in San Diego. You need to be the cleanest: tight lender execution, terms that reduce seller risk, and a strategy that doesn’t fall apart in escrow."
sections:
  - h: "The real game: sellers pick certainty"
    p: "Price matters, but certainty matters more than most buyers realize. Sellers pick the offer that feels most likely to close on time with the least drama."
    bullets:
      - "Clean financing beats shaky financing"
      - "Fast, predictable timelines beat slow ones"
      - "Fewer surprises beat ‘we’ll figure it out later’"

  - h: "Start with the lender: you need a real pre-approval"
    p: "If your financing is not credible, nothing else matters. A real pre-approval means the lender reviewed documents and can move fast."
    bullets:
      - "Use a lender who answers calls and knows the listing agents"
      - "Get documents reviewed before you offer"
      - "Ask for an underwritten approval if available (stronger than basic pre-approval)"

  - h: "Pick the right houses to compete on"
    p: "Some homes attract five buyers with cash and no contingencies. That’s not your battleground. Choose homes where your strengths matter."
    bullets:
      - "Target properties aligned with your loan type and condition tolerance"
      - "Avoid homes with obvious appraisal or inspection risk if your leverage is thin"
      - "Look for listings with longer DOM (days on market) where terms matter more than hype"

  - h: "Terms that actually help you win"
    p: "Most buyers try to compete with price only. Terms can reduce seller risk and make your offer feel inevitable."
    bullets:
      - "Shorter contingency timelines (only if you can execute)"
      - "Higher earnest money deposit (if you’re truly committed)"
      - "Flexible possession or rent-back (if it helps the seller)"
      - "Clear proof of funds and clean documentation"

  - h: "How to be aggressive without being reckless"
    p: "Aggressive does not mean stupid. It means confident, clean, and fast — with protections that match your real risk."
    bullets:
      - "Know your true max and don’t ‘bid drunk’"
      - "Use escalation clauses carefully (only in certain situations)"
      - "Avoid waiving contingencies unless you understand the property and your risk tolerance"

  - h: "Inspection strategy for normal buyers"
    p: "Inspection is where many deals break. You can protect yourself while still showing the seller you’re not going to nickel-and-dime."
    bullets:
      - "Inspect early and be decisive"
      - "Ask for major items only (health/safety/structural), not cosmetic nitpicks"
      - "Use repair credits strategically when appropriate"

  - h: "Appraisal risk: the quiet killer"
    p: "In San Diego, appraisal gaps happen. You need a plan before you offer, not after the appraisal comes in low."
    bullets:
      - "Ask your lender what value support looks like for that price range"
      - "Keep reserves if you may need to bridge a gap"
      - "Target homes with strong comp support when you’re stretching"

  - h: "Communication matters more than buyers think"
    p: "The best offers are sold, not just submitted. A good agent will communicate clearly and make your offer feel safe."
    bullets:
      - "Fast response time"
      - "Clean offer package"
      - "A short buyer letter or strategy note (when appropriate)"

  - h: "My agent process"
    p: "If you’re not the strongest buyer, we win by being the cleanest: lender alignment, tight offer terms, and a timeline that actually closes."
    bullets:
      - "We choose the right lender strategy for your profile"
      - "We target homes that match your risk and approval strength"
      - "We write offers that reduce seller fear and close cleanly"

  - h: "Related guides"
    p: "These tighten your budget, loan choice, and escrow execution."
