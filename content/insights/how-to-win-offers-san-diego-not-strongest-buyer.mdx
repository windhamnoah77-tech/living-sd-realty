excerpt: "If you’re not the strongest buyer, you don’t need luck. You need precision: target selection, credibility, and terms that reduce seller risk."
sections:
  - h: "Step 1: Stop targeting the wrong homes"

faq:
  - q: "Should I waive all contingencies to win?"
    a: "Not automatically. Waiving protections can create real risk. The smarter move is targeting the right properties and structuring a confident, clean offer."
  - q: "How do I compete if my credit is lower?"
    a: "Strong lender, clean proof of funds, disciplined documentation, and targeting homes that fit your loan profile. Precision beats desperation."
  - q: "Do love letters help?"
    a: "Sometimes, but they’re not the core strategy. Certainty, terms, and credibility win more often than emotional narratives."
