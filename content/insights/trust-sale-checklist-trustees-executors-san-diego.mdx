excerpt: "Inherited a home in San Diego? The first question is title: trust or probate. That one detail decides your timeline, your paperwork, and how cleanly you can sell."
sections:
  - h: "The fast answer"
    p: "If the home is held in a properly funded trust, you can often sell without probate. If it is not, you may be dealing with probate, court timelines, and added friction. Either way, the goal is simple: keep the process defensible, orderly, and predictable."
    bullets:
      - "Trust-held property: usually faster, fewer court steps"
      - "Probate property: often slower, more procedural, more risk points"
      - "Occupancy status (vacant vs occupied) changes everything"
  - h: "Step 1: Confirm how title is held"
    p: "Do not guess. Title controls authority. Authority controls the sale."
    bullets:
      - "Request the current vesting (title) and identify the legal owner"
      - "If trust: confirm the acting trustee and trustee powers"
      - "If probate: confirm who will have authority to sell (often the personal representative)"
  - h: "Realistic timelines (San Diego, real life)"
    p: "The timeline depends on the path and how organized the file is. The more uncertainty, the more buyers discount you."
    bullets:
      - "Trust path: often weeks, not months, if the file is clean"
      - "Probate path: can stretch out depending on court steps and complexity"
      - "Occupied property: adds access limits, buyer fear, and time"
  - h: "Costs you should expect"
    p: "Most families underestimate the cost of delay. Carrying costs and chaos are expensive."
    bullets:
      - "Carrying costs: mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance"
      - "Prep costs: cleaning, landscaping, paint, minor repairs (optional)"
      - "Transaction costs: escrow/title, commissions, buyer credits (case-by-case)"
  - h: "Pricing: defensible valuation, not vibes"
    p: "In trust and estate sales, pricing is an argument that should survive questions later. That means comps, condition framing, and a clear rationale."
    bullets:
      - "Use a tight comp set and document adjustments"
      - "Separate cosmetic issues from functional issues"
      - "Choose a strategy: as-is, light prep, or selective improvements"
  - h: "Offer strategy: highest price vs highest certainty"
    p: "A strong offer is not just price. It is certainty. A clean close protects the estate and your sanity."
    bullets:
      - "Verify proof of funds / lender strength up front"
      - "Prefer clean timelines and clear contingencies"
      - "Avoid buyers who negotiate emotionally and re-trade later"
  - h: "Execution: how to keep it clean"
    p: "Your edge is process. The cleanest closings feel boring. That is the goal."
    bullets:
      - "Build a single shared file: docs, invoices, decisions, timeline"
      - "Set a weekly update cadence for stakeholders"
      - "Front-load friction: HOA, title, permits, occupancy, access"
faq:
  - q: "How do I know if I can sell without probate?"
    a: "Start with title. If the property is held in a properly funded trust and the trustee has authority to sell, you can often proceed without probate. If not, probate may be required. For legal determinations, coordinate with qualified counsel."
  - q: "Should we sell the home as-is?"
    a: "Often yes, especially when speed and risk control matter. But as-is still requires disciplined disclosures and a pricing strategy that accounts for condition and buyer uncertainty."
  - q: "What if multiple heirs disagree?"
    a: "That is a governance issue first, not a real estate issue. Clarify authority, communication cadence, and decision rules early to avoid deal-killing conflict later."
  - q: "Do I need an attorney?"
    a: "If there is probate, disputes, tenancy, or unclear authority, coordinating with counsel is usually the smart move. The goal is risk control."
