excerpt: "Inherited houses in San Diego create two problems at once: emotional stress and expensive decisions. This guide gives you a clean decision tree, the real cost math (repairs, vacancy, management), and the tax basics (step-up basis) so you can pick a path you can defend."
sections:
  - h: "The situation: you inherited a San Diego house. Now what?"
    p: "This is one of those decisions where being “nice” can quietly cost six figures. An inherited house in San Diego is usually valuable, but it can also be a liability if you delay: taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancy, sibling conflict, and market risk all start running immediately. The goal is not to pick the most popular option. The goal is to pick the option you can justify financially and execute cleanly."
    bullets:
      - "Primary keyword: inherited house San Diego sell or rent"
      - "Secondary keywords: step-up in basis California, capital gains inherited property California, what to do with inherited house San Diego"
      - "This is a decision problem, not a real estate hype problem"

  - h: "Start here: the decision tree (simple and ruthless)"
    p: "You’re going to answer a few questions in order. Don’t skip steps. Skipping steps is how families end up fighting and losing money."
    bullets:
      - "Is the house vacant, tenant-occupied, or occupied by an heir?"
      - "Do you have multiple heirs/siblings, or one decision-maker?"
      - "Can the estate/heirs carry costs for 6–12 months without stress?"
      - "Is the property in ‘rent-ready’ condition, or will it require major work?"
      - "Is anyone emotionally attached to keeping it, and are they willing to pay for that preference?"
      - "Do you need liquidity soon (debts, taxes, distribution, buyouts)?"
      - "Is there a clear plan for management and accountability if you keep/rent?"

  - h: "Before you do anything: lock down facts (the first-week checklist)"
    p: "Most inherited-property messes happen because the basics were not handled fast. San Diego is expensive; small delays are expensive. Do this first so you stop bleeding."
    bullets:
      - "Confirm legal authority (trustee/executor/personal representative) and who can sign"
      - "Change/confirm insurance immediately (vacant homes often require different coverage)"
      - "Secure the property (locks, garage, windows, cameras if needed)"
      - "Stop leaks and prevent damage (water is a silent lawsuit)"
      - "Collect key documents: deed, mortgage statements, property tax info, HOA docs, utility history"
      - "Confirm occupancy status and access rules"
      - "Order a property condition triage (roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, foundation/red flags)"

  - h: "The tax concept everyone hears but few understand: step-up in basis (plain English)"
    p: "The step-up in basis is why inherited property decisions can be radically different from normal investing decisions. In simple terms: when someone dies, the tax “cost basis” of many inherited assets is adjusted to the property’s fair market value around the date of death (often determined by appraisal). That means appreciation that happened during the decedent’s lifetime may not be taxed as capital gain when the heirs sell — depending on the facts, timing, and whether it’s a trust/probate situation."
    bullets:
      - "“Basis” = the number used to calculate taxable gain"
      - "“Step-up” often resets basis closer to market value at death"
      - "Result: selling soon after inheritance can mean little to no capital gains tax (fact-dependent)"
      - "But: California and federal rules, entity structure, and timing matter — confirm with a qualified tax professional"

  - h: "Capital gains on inherited property in California (what people get wrong)"
    p: "People assume: “If I sell, I’ll get destroyed on taxes.” That’s often wrong with inherited property because of the step-up. What actually drives taxable gain is the difference between the sale price and the stepped-up basis (plus/minus allowable adjustments and selling costs)."
    bullets:
      - "If you sell soon after death and the market hasn’t moved much, taxable gain may be small"
      - "If you keep it for years and it appreciates after the date of death, that new appreciation can be taxable when sold"
      - "If you convert to rental, depreciation can create “depreciation recapture” later (real tax cost people ignore)"
      - "If you improve the property, certain improvements may increase basis (document everything)"
      - "If multiple heirs are involved, each person’s tax picture can differ"

  - h: "Sell vs Rent vs Keep: the financial model you actually need"
    p: "Most people compare options using vibes. Don’t. Compare options using cash flow, time, risk, and accountability. Here’s the framework I use so the decision is defensible."
    bullets:
      - "Option A: Sell now (speed + certainty)"
      - "Option B: Rent it (income + long-term equity, but management and risk)"
      - "Option C: Keep it for personal use (lifestyle choice that must be funded)"
      - "Option D: One heir keeps it and buys out the others (requires valuation + cash + agreement)"

  - h: "Option A: Sell the inherited house (when it’s the smartest move)"
    p: "Selling is usually the best choice when you need liquidity, when there are multiple heirs with different priorities, when the property needs major work, or when nobody wants to manage tenants. It’s not ‘giving up.’ It’s converting an illiquid asset into clean cash that can be distributed fairly."
    bullets:
      - "Best for: multiple heirs, urgent bills, deferred maintenance, conflict risk"
      - "Main advantage: converts complexity into clarity"
      - "Main risk: leaving money on the table if you misprice or choose the wrong strategy (as-is vs prep)"
      - "Execution lever: prep level and pricing discipline in your specific San Diego micro-market"

  - h: "Real sell costs in San Diego (ballpark categories)"
    p: "I’m not going to pretend one number fits every property. Here’s what actually shows up in real files. The point is to plan for categories, not guess a total."
    bullets:
      - "Pre-sale prep: cleaning, hauling, landscaping, paint/touch-ups, safety repairs"
      - "Deferred maintenance: roof, sewer line issues, water damage, electrical panels"
      - "Holding costs during sale: insurance, utilities, property taxes, HOA, yard maintenance"
      - "Transaction costs: escrow, title, transfer taxes, staging/photos, negotiated credits"
      - "Risk costs: buyer repair demands if you do not pre-inspect / pre-disclose"

  - h: "Option B: Rent the inherited house (when it works and when it’s a trap)"
    p: "Renting can be a strong move in San Diego if the property is rent-ready, the heirs can handle vacancy risk, and you have a legitimate management plan. But renting is not passive. It is a business with legal exposure and emotional stress, especially when siblings co-own."
    bullets:
      - "Best for: stable property, strong rental demand pocket, heirs aligned long-term"
      - "Main advantage: income + long-term appreciation potential"
      - "Main risks: vacancy, tenant damage, compliance issues, and sibling conflict over money"
      - "If the property needs heavy rehab, renting often becomes a delayed sale with extra headaches"

  - h: "Rent math: costs people ignore (and why they get burned)"
    p: "Most ‘rent vs sell’ decisions ignore costs that are guaranteed. Then the first repair or vacancy hits and the family panics. Here’s what to price in."
    bullets:
      - "Vacancy: assume at least some downtime between tenants"
      - "Turnover costs: paint, cleaning, minor repairs, marketing, screening"
      - "Property management: typically a monthly fee + leasing fee (varies)"
      - "Repairs and CapEx: roofs, HVAC, plumbing do not care about your timeline"
      - "Insurance changes for rentals and vacant periods"
      - "Legal compliance and notices (do not freestyle landlord-tenant law)"
      - "Reserve fund: if you don’t have reserves, you don’t have a rental plan"

  - h: "Option C: Keep it (the honest version)"
    p: "Keeping an inherited house is usually a lifestyle decision. That’s fine. But lifestyle decisions must be funded. If one heir wants to keep it, the clean way is: that heir pays carrying costs, and ideally buys out the others based on an agreed valuation. Anything less becomes resentment."
    bullets:
      - "Best for: one clear occupant, stable finances, agreement with other heirs"
      - "Main advantage: emotional value + long-term control"
      - "Main risk: family conflict and uneven financial burden"
      - "Rule: if you keep it, put the agreement in writing and make the money flow explicit"

  - h: "The siblings/heirs problem (where most files break)"
    p: "If multiple heirs are involved, the house is not just a property. It’s a negotiation. The failure mode is predictable: one person does work, one person delays decisions, one person wants top dollar, and nobody agrees on whether to rent or sell. The fix is structure."
    bullets:
      - "Pick one decision-maker (or a clear voting rule) and document it"
      - "Set a timeline with deadlines (not ‘we’ll see’)"
      - "Agree on valuation method (CMA + appraisal if needed)"
      - "If one heir keeps it: agree on buyout terms, timeline, and who pays what until then"
      - "If renting: choose management, reserve policy, and distribution policy in writing"
      - "If selling: decide prep strategy and pricing plan upfront to avoid sabotage later"

  - h: "San Diego-specific reality: what changes the decision here"
    p: "San Diego is not a generic market. The decision is affected by neighborhood and property type. Condos behave differently than SFRs. Coastal insurance behaves differently than inland. HOAs can change the math overnight. Short version: micro-market rules."
    bullets:
      - "HOA strength matters (reserves, litigation risk, special assessments)"
      - "Insurance reality matters (older roofs, location-specific risk, prior claims)"
      - "Permits and additions matter (ADU conversions, garage conversions, older remodels)"
      - "Tenant laws and enforcement matter if renting"
      - "Buyer expectations matter: coastal buyers punish uncertainty and deferred maintenance"

  - h: "A clean checklist: what to do with an inherited house in San Diego"
    p: "If you want a simple action plan, this is it. This prevents the two things that cost the most money: delay and conflict."
    bullets:
      - "Confirm authority and decision rights"
      - "Secure and insure the property"
      - "Get a condition triage and a realistic repair/cleanup estimate"
      - "Get a defensible valuation (not a guess)"
      - "Run the numbers for 3 scenarios: sell now, rent for 2 years then sell, keep/buyout"
      - "If multiple heirs: set timelines and responsibilities in writing"
      - "Choose: sell, rent, keep, or buyout — then execute without drifting"

  - h: "Get a free inherited property options sheet (CTA)"
    p: "If you want this decision made cleanly, I’ll put together a one-page options sheet for your specific property: estimated as-is value, likely prep range, sale timeline, rental readiness notes, and the decision points that matter in San Diego. No hype, just a clear plan you can share with siblings and counsel."
    bullets:
      - "Get a free inherited property options sheet: /contact"
      - "If you already have multiple heirs, tell me how many decision-makers there are and whether the home is occupied"
      - "If the home is tenant-occupied, I’ll coordinate a plan that respects California tenancy rules with appropriate counsel"

faq:
  - q: "Is it better to sell an inherited house right away in San Diego?"
    a: "Often yes if there are multiple heirs, deferred maintenance, or urgent cash needs. Selling converts complexity into clarity. But the best choice depends on condition, carrying costs, and whether the heirs can execute a rental plan responsibly."
  - q: "What is the step-up in basis in California?"
    a: "In many inherited-property situations, the tax basis is adjusted to the property’s fair market value around the date of death. That can reduce capital gains tax if you sell soon after inheritance. Your facts matter, so confirm with a qualified tax professional."
  - q: "Will I owe capital gains tax if I sell an inherited house in California?"
    a: "It depends on the stepped-up basis, the sale price, selling costs, improvements, and how long you hold the property after inheritance. Many people owe less than they assume if they sell near the inherited value."
  - q: "Can siblings rent an inherited house together without problems?"
    a: "They can, but only with a written plan: decision rules, reserve policy, management choice, expense sharing, and distribution rules. Without structure, it commonly turns into conflict."
