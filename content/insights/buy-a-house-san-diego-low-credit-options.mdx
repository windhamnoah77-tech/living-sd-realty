excerpt: "Lower credit doesn’t automatically block you in San Diego. It just means you need the right loan path, clean documentation, and a disciplined strategy so underwriting doesn’t blow up."
sections:
  - h: "What “low credit” really means"
    p: "A credit score is a risk signal, not a life sentence. Approval is about the full borrower profile: recent payment history, debt-to-income, stable income, and cash to close."
    bullets:
      - "Recent on-time history matters more than old mistakes"
      - "DTI and reserves can offset a weaker score"
      - "A clean file beats a messy one, even with a higher score"

  - h: "What lenders actually look at"
    p: "Most people focus on the score because it’s visible. Underwriters care about whether you can reliably repay and whether the documents match the story."
    bullets:
      - "Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)"
      - "Income type and stability (W-2 vs self-employed)"
      - "Bank statements and source of funds"
      - "Recent late payments, collections, charge-offs"
      - "Reserves after closing"

  - h: "Realistic loan paths when credit is lower"
    p: "The best option depends on your down payment, DTI, and documentation. A lender should run scenarios, not guess."
    bullets:
      - "Conventional: possible if the rest of the file is strong"
      - "FHA-style: often more forgiving, but not always cheaper long-term"
      - "VA (if eligible): can be powerful with a disciplined file"
      - "Non-QM: situational, often higher cost, used when docs/income are complex"

  - h: "The 30–60 day improvement plan that actually helps underwriting"
    p: "Don’t randomly open accounts, close cards, or dispute everything. That can backfire. Focus on the moves that improve the underwriting picture."
    bullets:
      - "Lower revolving utilization by paying balances down"
      - "Avoid new credit inquiries while getting pre-approved"
      - "Keep deposits clean and explainable"
      - "Gather documents early so the lender can fully underwrite"

  - h: "How to shop smart in San Diego while your credit is improving"
    p: "Touring houses before you have a real plan wastes time. In San Diego, weak financing gets punished by the market."
    bullets:
      - "Get a real pre-approval (not a pre-qual)"
      - "Pick a price range that fits underwriting, not just the payment you want"
      - "Target properties that match your loan type and risk profile"

  - h: "My advice as your agent"
    p: "With lower credit, you win by running a tighter process: lender coordination, clean docs, and an offer strategy that fits your approval strength without gambling."
    bullets:
      - "We pick the right lender for your profile"
      - "We structure a competitive offer that matches your actual approval"
      - "We avoid homes and terms that create underwriting drama"

  - h: "Related guides"
    p: "Use these to tighten your budget, choose the right loan type, and win offers in San Diego."

faq:
