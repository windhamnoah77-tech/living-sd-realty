excerpt: "Lower credit doesn’t mean you can’t buy in San Diego. It means you need a tighter plan: clean documentation, predictable cash flow, smart debt moves, and the right loan path."
sections:
  - h: "The truth about “low credit”"
    p: "A credit score is not your character. It’s a risk signal. Lenders price risk and approve stability. Your job is to present a clean, predictable borrower profile, not to argue with the system."
    bullets:
      - "Credit score affects rate, approval strength, and lender options"
      - "Your debt-to-income ratio and payment history often matter just as much"
      - "The goal is not perfection, it is financeability"
  - h: "What lenders actually care about"
    p: "Most buyers obsess over the score and ignore the bigger levers. Approval is usually a combination of score, income stability, cash reserves, and responsible use of debt."
    bullets:
      - "Recent payment history (especially last 12 months)"
      - "Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) and monthly obligations"
      - "Stable, documentable income and employment"
      - "Cash to close and reserves after closing"
  - h: "Realistic loan paths when credit is lower"
    p: "There are multiple ways to get financed. The best option depends on your income type, down payment, and how clean your file is. A lender should run scenarios, not guesses."
    bullets:
      - "Conventional financing can still work if the rest of the file is strong"
      - "FHA-style lending is often more forgiving on credit, but comes with its own costs and rules"
      - "VA (if eligible) can be powerful if the file is disciplined"
      - "Non-QM options exist for certain income profiles, but price and terms vary"
  - h: "Your 30–60 day credit clean-up plan"
    p: "Do not randomly open accounts, close cards, or dispute everything. That’s how people accidentally break their approval profile. Focus on the moves that help underwriting fast."
    bullets:
      - "Pay down revolving balances (utilization is a big lever)"
      - "Stop new credit applications while you’re getting pre-approved"
      - "Get all documentation organized early (income, bank statements, ID, etc.)"
      - "If you have late payments, build a clean recent track record and document explanations where appropriate"
  - h: "Down payment, reserves, and how to look stronger than your score"
    p: "If your credit is lower, you compensate with structure: reserves, predictable deposits, and low noise in your bank activity. Underwriters like boring."
    bullets:
      - "Keep funds seasoned and easy to source"
      - "Avoid unexplained cash deposits"
      - "Have reserves left over after closing if possible"
      - "Keep your monthly liabilities low going into underwriting"
  - h: "How to shop for a home without wasting time"
    p: "The biggest mistake is touring homes before your financing plan is real. In San Diego, the market punishes buyers who are not fully ready."
    bullets:
      - "Start with a real pre-approval (not a vague pre-qual)"
      - "Choose a price range that fits underwriting, not just the monthly payment you hope for"
      - "Target properties aligned with your loan type and risk profile"
  - h: "My advice as your agent"
    p: "If your credit is lower, you need a tighter process: clean lender communication, clean documentation, and an offer strategy that makes you competitive without gambling. I can coordinate the plan with a lender and run the purchase like a controlled operation."
    bullets:
      - "We pick the right lender for your profile"
      - "We build an offer strategy that fits your approval strength"
      - "We avoid homes and terms that create underwriting drama"
        - h: "Related guides"
    p: "If you want the clean path from lower credit to keys in hand, these are the companion reads."

faq:
  - q: "Can I buy in San Diego with low credit?"
    a: "Often, yes. The exact options depend on your income, debt, down payment, and recent payment history. The best first move is a lender conversation that produces clear scenarios and a timeline."
  - q: "Should I wait until my score improves?"
    a: "Sometimes. But waiting only makes sense if you have a specific plan and a short timeline to improvement. If you can become financeable in 30–90 days, you may be better off executing a controlled improvement plan rather than delaying indefinitely."
  - q: "What’s the fastest way to boost approval strength?"
    a: "In many cases: reduce revolving balances, avoid new credit, keep your bank activity clean, and stabilize documentation. Then run the file through a lender with the right program options."
  - q: "Should I use a credit repair company?"
    a: "Be careful. Some tactics can backfire during underwriting or create timing issues. If you go that route, coordinate with a mortgage professional so you don’t make moves that delay approval."
  - q: "What do you need from me to map the best path?"
    a: "Credit range, approximate income type (W-2 or self-employed), estimated down payment, monthly debts, and your target timeline. With that, we can create a realistic plan and buying range."
