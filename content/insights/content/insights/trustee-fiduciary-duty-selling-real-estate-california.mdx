excerpt: "Fiduciary duty isn’t a vibe. It’s a standard. Here’s how to sell a trust property in a way that’s defensible, documented, and hard to attack later."
sections:
  - h: "The fast answer"
    p: "Your job is to act prudently, document decisions, and avoid avoidable risk. The real estate side should be run like a professional file: pricing rationale, disclosures discipline, and clean execution."
    bullets:
      - "Defensible pricing beats optimistic pricing"
      - "Documentation prevents hindsight accusations"
      - "Process reduces conflict and buyer renegotiation"
  - h: "What trustees get wrong"
    p: "Most mistakes are not malicious. They are sloppy. Sloppy is expensive."
    bullets:
      - "No paper trail for pricing and decisions"
      - "Late disclosures and last-minute surprises"
      - "Stakeholders arguing mid-escrow"
  - h: "Defensible pricing (the core fiduciary move)"
    p: "Pricing should be supported by comps and condition framing. If a beneficiary asks 'why this price,' you should be able to answer in one minute with receipts."
    bullets:
      - "Tight comp set + documented adjustments"
      - "Condition narrative: what is known, what is unknown"
      - "Strategy choice: as-is vs light prep vs selective improvements"
  - h: "Disclosures: clean file discipline"
    p: "Buyers punish uncertainty. Clean disclosures reduce fear, shorten escrow friction, and reduce re-trades."
    bullets:
      - "Collect known facts, document unknowns, disclose consistently"
      - "Surface title/HOA/permit friction early"
      - "Set response timelines for inspections and requests"
  - h: "Communication: beneficiaries and stakeholders"
    p: "If you do not define the update cadence, the loudest person will set it for you."
    bullets:
      - "Weekly updates: what happened, what is next, what is needed"
      - "Centralize decisions and keep them written"
      - "Do not negotiate the deal via group chat"
  - h: "Offer selection: certainty is a fiduciary asset"
    p: "The highest offer is not always the best offer. A buyer who closes cleanly often nets more than a buyer who re-trades price after inspections."
    bullets:
      - "Verify strength: POF, lender quality, down payment reality"
      - "Prefer clean contingency structure and short timelines"
      - "Avoid buyers with patterns of late renegotiation"
  - h: "Close like a professional"
    p: "Boring closings are good closings. Your objective is reduced volatility."
    bullets:
      - "Front-load: title, HOA, insurance, occupancy"
      - "Track deadlines and enforce them"
      - "Keep a decision log (who approved what, when, and why)"
faq:
  - q: "Do trustees have to pick the highest price offer?"
    a: "Not necessarily. Trustees typically need to act prudently and in the beneficiaries’ best interest. Often that includes weighing certainty, terms, and risk. For legal guidance on your specific trust, coordinate with qualified counsel."
  - q: "What documentation should I keep?"
    a: "Keep your comp rationale, notes on condition and strategy choices, key emails/approvals, and a timeline of decisions. A clean file protects you."
  - q: "How do I reduce beneficiary conflict during the sale?"
    a: "Define the decision chain early, set a predictable update cadence, keep decisions written, and avoid negotiating the transaction through multiple informal channels."
