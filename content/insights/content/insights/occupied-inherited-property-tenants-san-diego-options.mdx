excerpt: "Tenants change the timeline, buyer pool, and leverage. Here are the clean paths that keep you protected and moving forward without chaos."
sections:
  - h: "The fast answer"
    p: "You usually have three paths: sell with tenants in place, negotiate vacancy first, or stabilize then sell. The right choice depends on timeline, access, and risk tolerance."
    bullets:
      - "Sell occupied: faster, smaller buyer pool"
      - "Vacate first: broader buyer demand, longer timeline"
      - "Stabilize: only if the numbers justify the time and risk"
  - h: "Start with facts, not assumptions"
    p: "Before strategy, confirm the actual tenancy situation. Guessing here can blow up a sale."
    bullets:
      - "Who lives there and under what agreement?"
      - "Rent amount and payment history"
      - "Access constraints for showings/inspections"
  - h: "Path 1: Sell with tenants in place"
    p: "This can be the cleanest path when time matters and access is limited, but expect pricing impact due to reduced buyer pool."
    bullets:
      - "Buyer pool shifts toward investors"
      - "Price reflects access + uncertainty + long-term risk"
      - "Set expectations: fewer showings, more due diligence questions"
  - h: "Path 2: Negotiate vacancy first"
    p: "Vacancy can widen the buyer pool and improve offer terms, but it adds time and coordination complexity."
    bullets:
      - "More retail buyers = more competition potential"
      - "Better inspection access and presentation"
      - "Higher likelihood of clean financing approvals"
  - h: "Path 3: Stabilize, then sell"
    p: "Sometimes stabilizing tenancy or property condition helps value. But if you do this, it must be planned, documented, and ROI-driven."
    bullets:
      - "Only when the upside outweighs the delay"
      - "Keep scope tight and timeline-controlled"
      - "Do not create a never-ending project"
  - h: "Access and showings: avoid chaos"
    p: "Occupied listings require discipline. The enemy is random access and emotional conflict."
    bullets:
      - "Set fixed showing windows"
      - "Use clear written communication"
      - "Limit unnecessary foot traffic to reduce tenant friction"
  - h: "Important caution"
    p: "Landlord-tenant rules can be complex and fact-specific. The smartest move is coordinated execution with appropriate counsel when tenancy issues affect the sale."
faq:
  - q: "Is it better to sell occupied or vacant?"
    a: "It depends. Occupied can be faster with fewer showings, but it often narrows the buyer pool. Vacant can improve demand and terms, but it usually takes longer."
  - q: "Will tenants reduce the price?"
    a: "Often yes, because access limits and uncertainty reduce buyer demand and increase perceived risk. The impact varies by lease terms, rent level, and condition."
  - q: "Can I just tell tenants to leave because we’re selling?"
    a: "Do not assume. Tenancy rights and timelines vary based on facts and law. If vacancy is required, coordinate the plan carefully and consult qualified counsel."
