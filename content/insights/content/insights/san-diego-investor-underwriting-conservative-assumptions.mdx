excerpt: "Most bad deals look great on a spreadsheet that assumes perfection. Conservative underwriting is how real investors stay alive when the market stops being cute."
sections:
  - h: "The fast answer"
    p: "Use ranges, not single numbers. Assume delays. Stress test the downside. Then structure terms to protect your exit."
    bullets:
      - "Rehab: low/base/high range"
      - "Rent: conservative comps + vacancy reality"
      - "Exit: realistic time + realistic price"
  - h: "The biggest mistake: single-number thinking"
    p: "If your deal only works with perfect rehab, perfect rent, and perfect timing, it does not work. It is a bet."
    bullets:
      - "Replace 'best case' with 'most likely'"
      - "Add buffers for surprises"
      - "Track your assumptions in writing"
  - h: "Rehab budgeting: ranges and triggers"
    p: "Rehab is where spreadsheets lie the most. Build ranges and define what pushes you from low to high."
    bullets:
      - "Low: cosmetic only"
      - "Base: cosmetic + minor systems"
      - "High: systems, permits, unknowns"
  - h: "Rent assumptions: conservative comps win"
    p: "Do not underwrite to the highest rent you saw online. Underwrite to what a real tenant will sign today, with vacancy and concessions accounted for."
    bullets:
      - "Use comparable rentals, not fantasy asks"
      - "Assume vacancy/turnover costs"
      - "Account for property-specific drawbacks"
  - h: "Downside framing: what breaks the deal?"
    p: "The real skill is identifying failure modes before you buy them."
    bullets:
      - "Title/disclosure risk"
      - "Access/occupancy risk"
      - "Financing/timing risk"
      - "Permit/scope creep risk"
  - h: "Terms that reduce risk"
    p: "Good terms are a profit center. Clarity reduces friction and protects your exit."
    bullets:
      - "Clear contingency structure and deadlines"
      - "Proof of funds and financing posture up front"
      - "Timeline discipline that matches the asset reality"
faq:
  - q: "Should I underwrite to current rates or future rate drops?"
    a: "Underwrite to what exists today. If rates improve later, that is upside. Building your base case on optimism is how investors get hurt."
  - q: "How do I choose rehab buffers?"
    a: "Start with ranges and track your historical variance. If you do not have history yet, assume higher variance and tighten your buying criteria."
  - q: "What matters more: price or terms?"
    a: "Both. But bad terms can destroy a good price. Clean structure and predictable timelines often beat aggressive pricing with chaos."
