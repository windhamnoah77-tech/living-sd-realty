excerpt: "San Diego is not forgiving to first-time buyers who wing it. This checklist gives you the clean order of operations so you don’t waste months, lose deals, or get wrecked in escrow."
sections:
  - h: "Step 1: Set a real budget (not vibes)"
    p: "Your budget is not what a lender will approve. It’s what you can carry comfortably while still living your life and keeping reserves."
    bullets:
      - "Decide your max monthly housing payment you can afford without stress"
      - "Plan for taxes, insurance, HOA, utilities, and maintenance"
      - "Keep a cash buffer after closing so you’re not house-poor"

  - h: "Step 2: Choose the right lender and get pre-approved"
    p: "In San Diego, pre-approval is your ticket to be taken seriously. A weak pre-qual is not enough."
    bullets:
      - "Get a real pre-approval with document review"
      - "Ask your lender to run scenarios (rates, down payment, buy-downs)"
      - "Do not open new credit or move money around during underwriting"

  - h: "Step 3: Pick the best loan path for your profile"
    p: "Loan choice affects competitiveness, appraisal risk, and the way your offer gets perceived."
    bullets:
      - "Conventional: often strongest perception, depends on score and DTI"
      - "FHA: can work well, but can add appraisal/condition sensitivity"
      - "VA: powerful if eligible, but still needs disciplined execution"

  - h: "Step 4: Build your ‘buy box’ (neighborhood + property type + deal breakers)"
    p: "The faster you get specific, the faster you win. Browsing randomly is how people waste months."
    bullets:
      - "Choose 3 to 5 target neighborhoods"
      - "Define must-haves vs nice-to-haves"
      - "Know your deal breakers: HOA rules, parking, layout, commute, condition"

  - h: "Step 5: Tour like a buyer, not a tourist"
    p: "Your first tours should teach you how the market actually feels: pricing, condition, and competition."
    bullets:
      - "Compare what list prices look like in reality"
      - "Track what homes actually sell for (not just what they list for)"
      - "Identify what condition level your loan can tolerate"

  - h: "Step 6: Write offers that win without gambling"
    p: "Winning in San Diego usually comes down to certainty, clean terms, and speed—not just price."
    bullets:
      - "Strong pre-approval and clean proof of funds"
      - "Tight timelines where realistic"
      - "Terms that match your true underwriting strength"

  - h: "Step 7: Escrow discipline (how deals die and how to prevent it)"
    p: "Most first-time buyers don’t lose money on price. They lose it on escrow chaos and bad timing."
    bullets:
      - "Schedule inspections early"
      - "Respond quickly to lender and escrow requests"
      - "Don’t change jobs, buy cars, or open credit lines during escrow"

  - h: "Step 8: Final walkthrough and closing"
    p: "Closing is the finish line. Your goal is to avoid last-minute surprises."
    bullets:
      - "Confirm repairs and agreed items"
      - "Review closing disclosure carefully"
      - "Plan your move and utilities before you get keys"

  - h: "My advice as your agent"
    p: "First-time buyers win by being prepared and decisive. I’ll coordinate lender strategy, narrow your buy box, and run the transaction like a controlled operation so you close cleanly."
    bullets:
      - "We align the loan path with your offer strategy"
      - "We target properties that match your risk profile"
      - "We stay ahead of escrow and underwriting deadlines"

  - h: "Related guides"
    p: "These tighten your budget, loan choice, and offer strategy so you win faster."

faq:
  - q: "How much money do I need to buy in San Diego?"
    a: "It depends on your down payment, closing costs, and reserves. Most buyers need enough for down payment plus closing costs and a post-close buffer so they’re not house-poor."
  - q: "Is pre-qualification enough to make offers?"
    a: "Not in most San Diego situations. A real pre-approval with document review is what makes sellers take you seriously."
  - q: "What makes an offer competitive besides price?"
    a: "Certainty: a strong lender, clean proof of funds, reasonable contingencies, and a timeline that shows you can close without drama."
