excerpt: "San Diego doesn’t reward guesswork. This is the clean checklist to go from 'thinking about buying' to keys in hand without chaos."
sections:
  - h: "Step 1: Get financially 'financeable'"
    p: "Before you tour homes, you need a lender game plan and clean documentation. Shopping without this wastes time and creates heartbreak."
    bullets:
      - "Know your credit range and monthly debts"
      - "Stop opening new credit while getting approved"
      - "Organize income documents and bank statements"
  - h: "Step 2: Get a real pre-approval"
    p: "Pre-approval is not the same as pre-qualification. You want a lender who actually reviews documents and runs the file seriously."
    bullets:
      - "Choose lender + loan type"
      - "Confirm budget range and monthly payment ceiling"
      - "Clarify cash-to-close and reserves"
  - h: "Step 3: Build your San Diego search strategy"
    p: "You’re buying a mix of location, condition, space, and terms. Be honest about tradeoffs."
    bullets:
      - "Define must-haves vs nice-to-haves"
      - "Pick target neighborhoods based on commute and lifestyle"
      - "Align with your loan type and competitiveness"
  - h: "Step 4: Make offers like you want to win"
    p: "In competitive pockets, the offer is a story: strength, certainty, and timeline."
    bullets:
      - "Clean financing letter and proof of funds"
      - "Tight timelines where appropriate"
      - "Terms that reduce seller fear"
  - h: "Step 5: Inspections and negotiations"
    p: "Inspections aren’t a weapon. They’re risk management. The goal is to confirm the home, not to start a war."
    bullets:
      - "Book inspections fast"
      - "Prioritize safety and big-ticket items"
      - "Negotiate like an adult: clear asks, justified by findings"
  - h: "Step 6: Escrow, appraisal, and closing"
    p: "This is where discipline pays off. Most delays are caused by missing docs, messy bank activity, or slow responses."
    bullets:
      - "Respond quickly to lender conditions"
      - "Avoid big purchases or money movement"
      - "Final walkthrough, closing disclosures, then keys"
        - h: "Related guides"
    p: "If you want to be competitive and financeable in San Diego, read these next."

faq:
  - q: "What’s the #1 first-time buyer mistake in San Diego?"
    a: "Shopping homes before being truly pre-approved and budgeted. It burns time and kills leverage."
  - q: "How much money do I need besides the down payment?"
    a: "Closing costs and usually some buffer. Exact amounts depend on loan type, price, and negotiated credits. Your lender should provide scenarios."
  - q: "When should I start talking to an agent?"
    a: "Early. A good agent helps you align neighborhoods, offer strategy, and loan realities so you don’t waste months."
