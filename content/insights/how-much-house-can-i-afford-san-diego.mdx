excerpt: "Your real budget is not what a lender approves. It’s what you can pay while still keeping reserves, living your life, and not panicking when something breaks."
sections:
  - h: "Start with a monthly number you can live with"
    p: "Forget the home price for a moment. Start with the monthly payment you can carry comfortably. In San Diego, stretching too far turns the home into a stress machine."
    bullets:
      - "Pick a max monthly housing payment that does not require perfect months"
      - "Keep room for savings, travel, and life"
      - "Plan for maintenance and random expenses"

  - h: "What’s inside your monthly payment"
    p: "Most buyers only think principal and interest. The real number includes taxes, insurance, HOA, and sometimes mortgage insurance."
    bullets:
      - "Principal + interest (your loan payment)"
      - "Property taxes"
      - "Homeowners insurance"
      - "HOA dues (if applicable)"
      - "Mortgage insurance (if applicable)"

  - h: "DTI: how lenders decide what you qualify for"
    p: "DTI is your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. Lenders use it to estimate repayment risk. Even if you qualify, you still want a comfortable budget."
    bullets:
      - "Lower DTI generally means more comfort and easier approval"
      - "Car payments and student loans hit your buying power hard"
      - "A strong file can sometimes stretch, but it’s not always wise"

  - h: "Down payment changes more than you think"
    p: "A larger down payment can reduce the monthly payment, help competitiveness, and reduce mortgage insurance. But draining your reserves can be a bad trade."
    bullets:
      - "More down payment usually lowers monthly payment"
      - "Mortgage insurance can drop or improve with stronger equity"
      - "Do not wipe out reserves just to hit a bigger down payment"

  - h: "Reserves: the part most buyers ignore"
    p: "If you buy with no reserves, you are one repair away from a financial mess. Reserves are what makes homeownership feel stable."
    bullets:
      - "Keep an emergency fund separate from your down payment"
      - "Aim to have cash left after closing"
      - "Reserves improve approval confidence and reduce stress"

  - h: "A simple affordability method that works"
    p: "This is the clean way to decide a max home price without pretending you can predict rates perfectly."
    bullets:
      - "Step 1: Choose your max monthly housing payment"
      - "Step 2: Subtract HOA (if any) and rough taxes/insurance estimates"
      - "Step 3: Use the remainder for principal + interest"
      - "Step 4: Have a lender run scenarios at current rates"
      - "Step 5: Choose the price range that keeps you comfortable"

  - h: "How to avoid becoming house-poor in San Diego"
    p: "The fastest way to hate your house is to stretch until you can’t breathe. A strong plan gives you ownership without financial panic."
    bullets:
      - "Avoid maxing out approval just because you can"
      - "Keep flexibility for repairs, lifestyle, and opportunities"
      - "Choose payment stability over ego"

  - h: "My advice as your agent"
    p: "I’ll help you set a real buying range, connect you with the right lender strategy, and target homes that match your loan path so you don’t waste months chasing deals that won’t close."

faq:
  - q: "Should I use an online affordability calculator?"
    a: "Use it as a rough starting point only. Your real budget depends on your lifestyle, reserves, debt payments, and how stable your income is."
  - q: "Is qualifying the same as affording?"
    a: "No. Qualifying is what a lender approves. Affording is what you can pay without sacrificing savings, lifestyle, and stability."
  - q: "What’s the biggest mistake buyers make?"
    a: "Stretching to the maximum approval, draining reserves, and ignoring taxes, insurance, and HOA. That’s how buyers become house-poor."
