excerpt: "Affordability isn’t a Zillow number. It’s a stability plan. Here’s how to set a San Diego budget that a lender approves and you can live with."
sections:
  - h: "Start with the payment you can live with"
    p: "Your real limit is the monthly payment you can carry without lifestyle collapse. Lenders approve based on math, but you should buy based on comfort plus margin."
    bullets:
      - "Pick a monthly payment ceiling that still lets you save"
      - "Leave room for repairs, life, and rate changes when you refinance later"
      - "If you’re stressed before you close, you’ll be stressed after you close"
  - h: "What goes into the monthly payment"
    p: "Most buyers underestimate the payment because they ignore the full stack. In San Diego, the difference matters."
    bullets:
      - "Principal + interest"
      - "Property taxes"
      - "Homeowners insurance"
      - "HOA (if applicable)"
      - "Mortgage insurance (if applicable)"
  - h: "DTI: the lender’s gatekeeper"
    p: "DTI is your debt-to-income ratio. It’s one of the biggest reasons buyers get capped below what they 'feel' they can afford."
    bullets:
      - "Lower monthly debts = more buying power"
      - "Car payments and credit cards hurt more than people think"
      - "Stable income documentation helps the approval story"
  - h: "Cash-to-close and reserves"
    p: "You don’t just need the down payment. You need closing costs and ideally reserves left over. Underwriters love boring bank statements."
    bullets:
      - "Down payment + closing costs is the baseline"
      - "Reserves after closing can strengthen your file"
      - "Avoid unexplained deposits while getting approved"
  - h: "The tradeoffs: location, condition, and leverage"
    p: "In San Diego you buy a mix of: location, space, condition, and terms. If you try to max all four, you’ll get stuck."
    bullets:
      - "Prime location usually means smaller or older"
      - "Fixer can be a deal or a disaster depending on your cash and tolerance"
      - "Strong terms can matter as much as price in competitive pockets"
  - h: "My agent rule: budget before browsing"
    p: "Touring homes before your budget is real is like test-driving a Ferrari with a Corolla loan. We build the budget first, then shop strategically."
    bullets:
      - "Get a real pre-approval tied to your documentation"
      - "Set a top price and a 'comfortable' price"
      - "Target homes that match your loan and approval strength"
        - h: "Related guides"
    p: "Use these to tighten your financing, sharpen your offer strategy, and avoid wasting time."

faq:
  - q: "Should I buy at the maximum a lender approves?"
    a: "Usually no. Approval is not comfort. The best buyers build margin so the home doesn’t own them."
  - q: "What’s the biggest affordability mistake?"
    a: "Ignoring the full payment stack (taxes, insurance, HOA, mortgage insurance) and underestimating repairs and lifestyle costs."
  - q: "How do I increase buying power fast?"
    a: "Reduce monthly debts, pay down revolving balances, avoid new credit, and get income documentation clean. Then re-run scenarios with a lender."
