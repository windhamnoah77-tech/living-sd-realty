excerpt: "A 1031 exchange can be the cleanest way to defer taxes and keep your equity compounding, but the timelines are brutal and the property strategy matters. Here’s how to run a San Diego 1031 like a controlled operation."
sections:
  - h: "What a 1031 exchange actually does (and what it doesn’t)"
    p: "A 1031 exchange (Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code) lets you defer capital gains tax by selling an investment or business-use property and reinvesting the proceeds into another qualifying property. The key word is defer. It does not erase tax forever, and it does not apply to primary residences (that’s a different set of rules)."
    bullets:
      - "It defers capital gains and depreciation recapture (not a promise to eliminate them)."
      - "It requires a like-kind replacement property (real estate for real estate, broadly)."
      - "It requires a Qualified Intermediary (QI) to handle exchange funds."
      - "It is about process control: timelines, documentation, and replacement strategy."
  - h: "San Diego reality check: why 1031s are harder here"
    p: "San Diego is a competitive, low-inventory market with micro-market pricing and fast-moving listings. That combination makes the 45-day identification window feel like a sprint on a treadmill. The problem isn’t that 1031 rules are complicated. The problem is that San Diego selection pressure punishes indecision, sloppy underwriting, and weak replacement options."
    bullets:
      - "Inventory is tight, so replacement options can be limited when you need them most."
      - "Many attractive properties have HOA and disclosure complexity that can slow escrow."
      - "Buyers face appraisal risk when pricing runs ahead of comps in hot pockets."
      - "If you wait until after you sell to plan, you’re already late."
  - h: "The two deadlines that control your life: 45 days and 180 days"
    p: "A 1031 exchange has two primary clocks. Miss either, and the exchange fails. These clocks do not care about weekends, emotions, or the fact that your replacement deal is ‘almost there.’"
    bullets:
      - "Day 0: the day your relinquished property closes (the sale)."
      - "45-day identification deadline: you must identify replacement property(ies) in writing to your QI by midnight of day 45."
      - "180-day exchange deadline: you must close on the replacement property(ies) by day 180 (or the tax return due date, whichever is earlier)."
      - "If you need more time, your solution is planning, not begging the calendar."
  - h: "Qualified Intermediary (QI): non-negotiable, and picked before you sell"
    p: "If you touch the sale proceeds, you’ve got constructive receipt and you’re done. The QI is the neutral third party who holds the funds and documents the exchange. Choose your QI early, coordinate your escrow instructions correctly, and treat it like a mission-critical vendor."
    bullets:
      - "Hire the QI before the sale closes."
      - "QI must receive the funds directly from escrow at closing."
      - "Your identification must be delivered to the QI in the correct format and by the deadline."
      - "Coordinate with your CPA/tax advisor early so your exchange structure matches your tax strategy."
  - h: "Like-kind and ‘investment intent’: where people get cute and get cooked"
    p: "Like-kind for real estate is broad, but the property must be held for investment or business use. The minute you try to 1031 a primary residence, a flip, or a personal-use beach condo you ‘might rent sometimes,’ you’re inviting problems. Intent matters, and your facts need to support your story."
    bullets:
      - "Investment property to investment property is the standard case."
      - "Short-term ‘I bought it to flip’ is not a clean 1031 narrative."
      - "Converting a replacement into a personal-use property immediately after closing is a common audit magnet."
      - "If you want flexibility, plan for it up front with proper holding periods and documentation."
  - h: "Boot: the silent tax trigger you don’t notice until it’s too late"
    p: "‘Boot’ is value you receive that isn’t like-kind replacement value: cash out, debt reduction without replacement, credits that function like cash, or anything that leaves you with less reinvested value than you sold. Boot is taxable. A lot of exchanges technically ‘work’ but still trigger tax because people accidentally created boot."
    bullets:
      - "Cash boot: you didn’t reinvest all net proceeds."
      - "Mortgage boot: you reduced debt and didn’t replace it with equal or greater debt (or cash)."
      - "Credits: certain repair credits or concessions can be treated as boot depending on structure."
      - "Rule of thumb: replace equal or greater value and reinvest all net proceeds."
  - h: "Identification strategy: pick a rule and execute it"
    p: "You don’t ‘kind of’ identify property. You follow a rule. Most exchanges use one of these identification frameworks, and your QI will want it stated clearly."
    bullets:
      - "3-Property Rule: identify up to three properties regardless of value."
      - "200% Rule: identify more than three as long as total value doesn’t exceed 200% of the relinquished property value."
      - "95% Rule: identify any number, but you must acquire 95% of the value identified (rare, stressful)."
      - "San Diego move: identify a primary target plus at least one realistic backup."
  - h: "San Diego replacement property tactics that actually work"
    p: "In San Diego, the best 1031 strategy is usually to design the replacement plan before you list the relinquished property. That may mean narrowing neighborhoods, property types, and deal structures that can close inside your window. You’re not just shopping. You’re engineering a closing."
    bullets:
      - "For speed: focus on cleaner assets with fewer unknowns (condition, HOA docs, tenants, title)."
      - "For competition: assume you will need a strong lender and clean terms, even as an investor."
      - "For risk control: avoid ‘story deals’ with ambiguous rents, unpermitted work, or messy tenant situations."
      - "For flexibility: consider a DST or NNN option as a backup if inventory tightens."
  - h: "DST and NNN: the backup plan that saves exchanges"
    p: "Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) interests and some net-lease structures are popular 1031 replacements when buyers want less management or when the 45-day clock is about to win. DSTs are not magic. They can be useful tools when you need certainty and time efficiency."
    bullets:
      - "DST can help with timing when you can’t find a clean direct purchase fast enough."
      - "NNN can simplify management and provide predictable cash flow, depending on tenant quality."
      - "Do real due diligence: sponsor quality, fees, tenant strength, location risk, exit strategy."
      - "Use them as part of a portfolio strategy, not a panic button."
  - h: "Escrow, inspections, appraisal: where San Diego deals break"
    p: "Most ‘failed’ 1031s fail for ordinary reasons: the replacement deal doesn’t close in time. In San Diego, delays often come from HOA document timing, condition discoveries, insurance availability, appraisal gaps, or lender underwriting friction."
    bullets:
      - "HOA docs and review periods can eat your calendar. Start early."
      - "Condition issues: get inspections scheduled immediately and interpret results like an investor, not a tourist."
      - "Appraisal risk: if you’re financing, underwrite conservatively and don’t assume the appraiser will match your optimism."
      - "Underwriting friction: avoid new debt, new accounts, or income changes mid-exchange if you’re borrowing."
  - h: "A clean 1031 workflow (what I’d have you do as your agent)"
    p: "A successful 1031 is not ‘finding a property.’ It’s sequencing. Here’s the operational workflow that keeps you out of chaos."
    bullets:
      - "Before listing: interview QIs, align with a lender, set replacement criteria, and pre-underwrite neighborhoods and asset types."
      - "During marketing: keep replacement scouting live; you want options already warming up."
      - "At sale escrow: confirm QI instructions and that you never touch proceeds."
      - "Day 1–45: identify primary and backup replacements using an identification rule you can execute."
      - "Day 46–180: close replacement with aggressive timeline management and early doc collection."
  - h: "Common 1031 mistakes I see (and how to avoid them)"
    p: "Most mistakes are preventable. The people who get hurt usually confuse optimism for a plan."
    bullets:
      - "Waiting until after the sale closes to start shopping seriously."
      - "Identifying ‘dream’ replacements that were never realistic to buy."
      - "Choosing a replacement with known timeline landmines (HOA chaos, tenant litigation, major condition unknowns)."
      - "Accidentally creating boot through concessions or debt mismatch."
      - "Working with vendors who don’t run 1031s regularly (QI, escrow, lender, agent)."
  - h: "San Diego-specific example scenarios"
    p: "These examples are simplified, but they show what ‘strategy’ actually looks like in a local market."
    bullets:
      - "Scenario A: Sell a small rental in Clairemont and exchange into a higher-income property in a neighborhood with cleaner rent comps and fewer deferred maintenance surprises."
      - "Scenario B: Sell a coastal condo rental with HOA friction and exchange into a small multi-unit where underwriting is based on real rents and long-term demand."
      - "Scenario C: Sell an older duplex and use a DST backup identification so the exchange survives if direct inventory disappears during the 45-day window."
  - h: "Important note: tax advice and legal advice"
    p: "This guide is educational. A 1031 exchange is tax law, and details matter. You should coordinate with a qualified tax advisor and your QI to confirm structure, deadlines, and any state-specific considerations for your situation. My role is to make the real estate execution clean so your tax strategy has a chance to work."
faq:
  - q: "Can I do a 1031 exchange on my primary residence in San Diego?"
    a: "Generally no. Primary residences are typically handled under different tax rules. A 1031 is for investment or business-use real estate. Talk to a tax advisor about the right strategy for your facts."
  - q: "Do I have to buy a replacement property in San Diego?"
    a: "No. Like-kind real estate can be anywhere in the U.S. Many San Diego investors exchange into other markets to improve cash flow, diversify risk, or find easier inventory."
  - q: "What if I can’t find a replacement within 45 days?"
    a: "Then the exchange fails. That’s why planning before you sell matters, and why identifying realistic backups (including DST or other options) can protect the exchange."
  - q: "How many properties can I identify?"
    a: "Most exchanges use the 3-property rule or the 200% rule. Your QI can confirm the format and documentation needed for your identification."
  - q: "Does a 1031 eliminate taxes forever?"
    a: "Usually it defers taxes. The deferral can continue through multiple exchanges, but what happens long-term depends on your broader plan and tax situation. Get personalized advice from a qualified tax professional."
